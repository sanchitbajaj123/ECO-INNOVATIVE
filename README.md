# Eco Innovate
Eco Innovate is a pioneering project dedicated to transforming agricultural practices through the application of cutting-edge deep learning techniques. Developed using Keras and TensorFlow frameworks, Eco Innovate utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to predict crop yields and detect diseases, empowering farmers to make data-driven decisions.

# Project Overview
Eco Innovate employs a blend of soil and climate sensors to gather environmental data, including soil pH, temperature, humidity, sunlight exposure, and moisture levels. Using AI/ML algorithms, the software analyzes this data and compares it with an extensive database of information on various fruits and plants. This system provides actionable insights to farmers, enabling them to optimize their agricultural practices for better yield and disease management.

# Key Features
* Intelligent Recommendations: The system provides personalized plant recommendations based on thorough analysis, considering factors crucial for plant growth.
* Informative Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard assists users in interpreting data received from sensors and facilitates predictions through an interactive UI.
* Accurate Dataset: A meticulously crafted dataset of over 1500 records, created under the guidance of agricultural experts, ensures accurate predictions and reliable recommendations.

# Technologies Used
1. Deep Learning Frameworks: Keras, TensorFlow
2. Programming Languages: Python
3. Data Collection: Soil and climate sensors
4. Database: Extensive agricultural database
